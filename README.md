## Overview

ArbFlow demonstrates the transformative potential of AI-driven DeFi automation by creating an intelligent, accessible platform. By leveraging advanced natural language processing, machine learning, real-time market analysis, and decentralized infrastructure, ArbFlow bridges DeFi complexity with user-sovereign automation.

The purpose is to democratize access to DeFi activities such as liquid staking, swaps, bridging, yield optimization, rebalancing, and token research. ArbFlow empowers users to interact with DeFi using simple NLP commands while maintaining verifiability, transparency, and full custody of their assets on the Arbitrum Ecosystem.

## Integrations and Protocols -
ArbFlow integrates with powerful decentralized infrastructure and liquidity protocols to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable automation across DeFi:

- **Skynet Protocol** – Provides decentralized, verifiable, and censorship-resistant infrastructure for ArbFlow’s AI agents. This ensures computations and intent executions are transparent, trustless, and not dependent on centralized servers.
- **Li.Fi Bridge & DEX Aggregation Protocol** – Powers cross-chain asset transfers with deep liquidity and optimal routing, enabling ArbFlow to execute user intents seamlessly across multiple ecosystems.
